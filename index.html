            <h2>Sampson 101</h2>
                  <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">Sampson was born on July 31, 2017. He is an Australian Cattle Dog, a herding breed that is also commonly known as a Red Heeler. He weighs a healthy 40lbs. His fluffy coat is red and white, with spots of red covering his white legs and paws. His upturned eyebrows make him appear concerned at all times. Sampson closest friends include Avocado, the black lab who lives downstairs, and Tuna and Pickle, the two cats he lived with as a puppy.</p>

            <h2>Sampson's Adoption</h2>
            <p>Sampson was adopted from Five Acres Animal Shelter in St. Charles, Missouri in April of 2019. Before coming home, Sampson had to meet and earn the approval of his adoptive sister Nola, a 12yr old black lab. She found his puppy energy annoying at first but quickly learned to tolerate his snuggles and bids for attention. After winning her over, Sampson finally came home. He was 9 months old and weighed 25lbs. He was already potty trained and knew how to sit, lay down, and shake. That summer he showed of his smarts by quickly learning how to walk politely on a leash. Before arriving at the shelter, Sampson came from a home where he was kept in a dog crate all day. He was not allowed out except to go to the bathroom and to go on a short walk. The only way he could release all his energy was to chew on the bars of his cage, and this got him in a lot of trouble with his previous owner. On his adoption file, Sampson was described as a destructive and terrible dog, but with proper exercise and lots of new chew toys, it quickly became apparent that those claims could not be farther from the truth. Samson is extremely smart, loyal, playful, goofy, and loving. After coming home, Sampson quickly became my very best friend.</p>
